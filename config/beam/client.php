    |            package. Null/unset ⇒ the audit is UNAVAILABLE (degrade-not-fabricate): it reports
    |            zero findings rather than fabricate drift.
    | `node`   — the node interpreter (resolved on PATH; default `node`).
    | `timeout`— the per-invocation process timeout, seconds.
    | `exclude_dirs` — directory names skipped entirely (both as a wrapper source and as an import
    |            site) — e.g. a domain mid-refactor in a concurrent diff.
    |

    | `SdkEndpointDriftAudit`/`SdkNameConventionAudit` scan: the composer package name (resolved via its
    | `vendor/` install path — works for both a local path-repo checkout and a normal CI git clone) and the
    | PHP namespace its `Requests/` classes live under. Defaults match this repo's own `splicewire/laravel-connector`;
