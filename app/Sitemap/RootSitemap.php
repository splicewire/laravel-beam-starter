/**
 * The starter's worked Frame example — it teaches the record→project pattern by BEING it.
 *
 * A composition of ordered sections; each section holds one or more pluggable leaves that
 * are either kind C ({@see ContentGlobLeaf}, derived docs — the default) or kind A
 * ({@see RecordLeaf}, an owner-edited record). Rendering a section resolves every leaf to
 * a flat NavItem list and orders it by `NavItem::$order`.
 *
 * ── The three starter-packaging dials, as built (see ticket 09) ─────────────────────────
 *  1. trunk-vs-branch:   the RootSitemap lives at the TRUNK (app root) — it is the app's
 *                        whole nav chrome, not one section's sub-nav.
 *  2. full-record vs escape-hatch:  DEFAULT is derived-nav (all-C); the record leaf is an
 *                        OPT-IN escape hatch a clone plugs into a section only when it wants
 *                        owner-editable chrome (+ off-host links). Not a full-record nav.
 *  3. runtime-merge:     the record projection merges into the trunk at RUNTIME, cache-busted
 *                        on save (see {@see RecordLeaf}) — never at build.
 *
 * `default()` returns the ALL-C starter nav: no RecordLeaf, so no DB/record lookup. A clone
 * opts in with `->withRecordLeaf('resources')` (or by adding a RecordLeaf to any section).
