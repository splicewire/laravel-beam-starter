     * `DefaultEntitlementResolver` composes the coarse `author-ux` key as soon as ANY single realm is
     * granted (mirroring old blanket-staff semantics for a Team holding EVERY realm's grant) — an
     * `author-ux-{realm} = author-ux || ...` shortcut would let a grant on just ONE realm leak
     * authoring into every OTHER realm too, defeating the per-realm grain this Gate exists for. A
     * grantee of every realm still authors every realm (each `author-ux-{realm}` key composes
     * independently); a narrowly-granted principal now correctly stays narrow.
