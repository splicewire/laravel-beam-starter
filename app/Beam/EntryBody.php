 * Server-side reader for a beam-ux entry's JsonDoc body (theme-entries-and-authoring STR-03), ported

 * generalization — "the auth pages (Fortify views) reuse one reader" — never applied there either).
 *
 * Public/GUEST surfaces (the auth pages: `/login`, `/register`, …) can't client-fetch the auth-gated
 * `beam.ux.entries.body.*` transport (`VisualEditorMount`'s author-mode-only load/save), so their
 * bodies are resolved HERE, server-side, and handed to the page as a prop.
 *
 * **Degrade-not-fabricate.** When the entry ROW is absent (fresh DB / never seeded) — or has no
 * particle body — this returns `null`, and the client's `PageEditor` falls back to its own default
 * tree (`editor/defaults.ts`). An app-critical page (login) thus never blanks because its beam-ux row
 * is missing.
