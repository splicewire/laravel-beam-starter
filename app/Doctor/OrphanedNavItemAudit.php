/**
 * Advisory doctor check (a moat-free {@see Finding} from rushing/laravel-doctor): validate
 * every record-leaf (kind A) nav link against the app's REAL registered routes and report
 * drift. A record link can rot in a way a content-glob (kind C) leaf cannot — an owner can
 * point a NavItem at a path that no route serves (a rename, a removed page), producing an
 * "orphaned" nav item. This surfaces that drift.
 *
 * ── Semantics (advisory, NEVER a hard fail — mirrors the base BeamDoctor's presence-conditional
 *    checks) ──
 *   - PASS  when every in-host record link resolves to a registered route path (external links
 *           are skipped — off-host targets are not the app's to validate). Also PASSes on a pure
 *           all-C nav (no record leaf) — nothing to orphan.
 *   - WARN  when one or more in-host record links resolve to no registered route (the drift signal).
 *
 * ── Plugging into the base doctor ──
 *   Registered — ADVISORY — into beam-core's `BeamDoctorManifest` from this app's own
 *   {@see AppServiceProvider}, so one `splicewire:beam:doctor` run reports it
 *   alongside the rest of the family. A HOST registers through exactly the same seam a package
 *   does: the manifest is a container singleton bound in beam's register phase and read fresh at
 *   command invocation, and an app's boot runs after every package's register — so there is no
 *   boot-order problem and no package-only constraint. (An earlier starter-local `sitemap:doctor`
 *   command claimed the base doctor "offers no host extension seam"; that was written ten days
 *   before the manifest existed and has been deleted.)
