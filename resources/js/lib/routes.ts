// Beam client runtime — the `routes_import` half of the generated client's runtime contract
// (`beam.client.routes_import`, default '@/lib/routes'). Published by
// `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=beam-client-runtime`; after publishing this file is YOURS —
// the generator imports it but never writes it. Contract reference:
// splicewire/laravel-beam docs/client-runtime-contract.md.
//
// This is the one-tier (satellite) reference implementation: generated defaults only. A host with
// an operator tier additionally exports `operatorRoute` over `operatorDefaults`; a host that
// hydrates or overrides routes at runtime layers that on top (the platform host is the precedent).
// `RouteMap` is exported BY the generated file — the generator owns that type, not this module.
