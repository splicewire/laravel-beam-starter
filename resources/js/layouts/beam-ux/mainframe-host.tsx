 * entry-body load, `useBeamUxEntry`); this host supplies only the host-local pieces: the component→entry
 * map, the ribbon chrome, and the editor/inspector renderers (which mount the promoted visual editor).
 *
 * Two modes (child-swap-under-a-stable-host):
 *   - `domain` (read) — the page renders as the Mainframe `main` payload. `readMode: 'page'` means the
 *     real Inertia page renders unchanged (it carries its own chrome), so read mode is a no-op swap.
 *   - `window` (author WYSIWYG) — for a signed-in author (`ux.author`), `main` swaps to the in-place
 *     visual editor (@/editor).
