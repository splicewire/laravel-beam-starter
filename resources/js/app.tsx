 * is the first one a fresh install hits. `useQuery` throws outside a provider and offers no supported
 * way to detect one, so this has to be mounted by the host; the package ships `<ManifestTableView>`

 * 84 lines, byte-identical in all three starters and independently grown to 262 and 285 on two real
 * hosts. The page now comes from `@splicewire/beam-ux/pages`, and everything only a host has arrives
 * through this one call, because an Inertia page's props come from the server and there is no other
 * channel from here into it.
 *
 * `wrap` is this site's chrome. Every public entry — the docs pages, a marketing page, a legal page —
 * renders inside `<SiteLayout>`, which is a fact about this HOST rather than about any one entry, so
 * it belongs here and not in an entry's `layout` column. An entry that wants the docs rail declares
 * `layout: DocsLayout` and gets it NESTED inside this.
 *
 * Putting a file back at `resources/js/pages/site/entry.tsx` overrides the packaged page outright —
 * the resolver below checks this host's own glob first. That is the whole override mechanism.
