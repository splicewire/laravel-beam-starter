/**
 * The ACCOUNT-realm team surface — members, roles and invitations.
 *
 * The page body is `@splicewire/beam-accounts`' own <TeamPage>: the merged member/invitation roster,
 * the invite dialog, the inline role select, and the remove/revoke/resend confirmations. This file
 * supplies the transport, the feedback sink, and the one fact the package cannot read for itself —
 * WHO is looking, which is what decides the owner-only lens.
 *
 * ⚠️ This replaces the tenant frame console's `/members` and `/invitations` leaves, which have been
 * removed from `config('frame.realms')['tenant']`. Read that file's realm comment: the console's
 * "New invitation" button was a DEAD CONTROL there — `invitations` declares `showable: false,
 * editable: false`, so it has no `/:id` record twin, and the console's list override derives the
 * toolbar's `onNew` from the same `onOpen` it only passes when a twin exists.
