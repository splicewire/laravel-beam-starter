/**
 * `G3-FRAME-SOCKET-REALM-BLIND` — the host-tier proof that this starter's `config('frame.realms')`
 * is an AUTHORIZATION and not only a projection.
 *
 * The leak was measured on a fresh TOWER (`https://fresh-tower.test`, 2026-09-12) as `demo-member`,
 * an ordinary tenant user already 403'd at `/operator` — but the socket, the middleware and the
 * operator realm list are identical here, so this starter carried the same hole:
 *
 * ```
 * GET /frame/resources/users    → 200  every user row, with its email
 * GET /frame/resources/teams    → 200  every team
 * ```
 *
 * Frame mounts ONE socket for every realm under `frame.middleware` (`['web','auth']` here), so no
 * value of that key could refuse the operator realm's resources without refusing the tenant realm's
 * too. The gate is per-resource and lives in the package —
 * `Splicewire\Beam\Realm\RealmEntitlementResourceGate`, bound over
 * `Schemastud\Frame\Contracts\ResourceAccessGate` — and reads THIS file's realm list plus
 * `beam.core.realm_gates.operator`.
 *
 * The package suite proves the rule; this proves the wiring: that the mount, the middleware, the
 * realm list and the entitlement cascade at this host actually meet.
 *
 * ⚠️ Scope, stated so a green run is not read as more than it is: this asserts the resources this
 * host places in the operator realm. A resource in NO realm is still served to any authenticated
 * principal by design — `members`, `invitations` and `tokens` depend on exactly that, and
 * `G1-BEAM-SCOPE-ISOLATION` is what proves their row-level scope instead.
