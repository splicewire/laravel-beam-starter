 * `resources/schemas/App/**` is a COMMITTED generated artifact — beam's particle doctrine says so
 * ("schemas:generate → resources/schemas (JSON Schema, committed)"), and `.prettierignore` already
 * carries it as "PHP Data generator output". Until now the tracking was simply never done, so a fresh
 * clone had no projections at all and nothing said a word.
 *
 * This is the verification half of docs/conventions/regenerating-committed-artifacts.md — *regeneration
 * is a command, verification is a test, the test never writes*. It writes nothing; `schemas:generate`
 * is the command, and the audit already names it in its own failure text.
 *
 * ⚠️ It drives {@see SchemaProjectionDriftAudit} rather than re-deriving the expected schema. That is
 * deliberate and the audit's own docblock says why: a second hand-rolled copy of the generation logic
 * DISAGREED with the real command and cost a host a permanent phantom "stale" finding no regeneration
 * could clear. One implementation, driven from a test — never a second one to compare against.

/**
 * Regenerate into a throwaway directory and compare it, byte for byte, against the committed tree.
 *
 * The audit above sees only DECLARED particle classes (one, at this starter), so on its own it left
 * every other projection unguarded against the failure that matters most: STALENESS. Change a property on
 * a page-data class, skip `schemas:generate`, and the audit — and the structural existence check this
 * replaced — both stayed green. Comparing a real regeneration closes all four holes at once:
 *
 *   - a class with no committed projection  → present in the regeneration, absent from the tree
 *   - a projection whose class is gone      → present in the tree, absent from the regeneration
 *   - a projection that is stale            → same path, different bytes
 *   - a projection that is empty or corrupt → same path, different bytes
 *
 * It drives the REAL command through its first-class `--output` override rather than re-deriving a
 * schema, for the reason the audit's own docblock records: a second hand-rolled copy of the generation
 * logic disagreed with the real one and cost a host a permanent phantom finding. This is the estate's
 * named precedent for the shape — splicewire-app's SdkRegenDriftGuardTest — and it keeps the convention:
 * the test writes only to a throwaway directory, never to the tracked tree.
 *
 * ⚠️ `--output` re-points `filesystems.disks.<schema disk>.root` in config and forgets the resolved disk.
 * SchemaProjectionDriftAudit reads through that SAME disk, so a leaked redirect would make the audit
 * compare the throwaway directory against itself and pass vacuously. The `finally` restores both, rather
 * than trusting per-test application refresh to do it.
 *
 * Environment note: the committed projections are generated with SCHEMA_BASE_URI unset, so their `$id`
 * is the class short name. A machine that sets SCHEMA_BASE_URI will regenerate different bytes and fail
 * here — which is correct: that machine's output is not what is committed.
