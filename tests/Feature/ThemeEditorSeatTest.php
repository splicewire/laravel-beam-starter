/**
 * G2-BEAM-THEME-NAV — the theme entry's editor SEAT at this host (`/account/theme`).
 *
 * The acceptance row asks for a theme token to be editable "through the real UI". The mechanism for
 * that already existed end to end — the `body` / `save-body` operations, `EntryBodyEnvelope::schemaFor()`
 * answering a `UxType::Theme` entry with `ThemeSchemas`' JSON Schema, `ThemeResolver`'s cascade into
 * `page.props.theme`, and `<SiteLayout>`'s `--theme-site-*` block reading it. What did not exist was a
 * page that mounted any of it: the theme row has no `segment`, so nothing routed to it and the in-place
 * editor dock (which attaches to a RENDERED page) never had one to attach to.
 *
 * This pins the seat, and specifically the one thing only the server can supply: **the entry id**. A
 * theme row's id is a per-database uuid, so a frontend that hardcoded or guessed it would work on the
 * machine it was written on and 404 everywhere else — which is why the page is prop-addressed and why
 * the prop is asserted here against the row {@see ThemeSeeder} actually created.
 *
 * @see \App\Support\PageEntryRef::theme()
