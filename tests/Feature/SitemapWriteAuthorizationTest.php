/**
 * The host half of the fail-closed write gate: `sitemap` is this starter's only fully write-capable
 * Frame resource, and {@see SitemapRecord} is the starter's own model, so the starter — not a
 * package — owes it a policy.
 *
 * `Schemastud\Frame\Authorization\ResourceAuthorizer` refuses a write against a model with no policy
 * for EVERY actor, owner included. Measured here 2026-09-05, before `SitemapRecord` carried
 * `#[UseCascadePolicy]`: `POST /frame/resources/sitemap` as `demo-owner@example.test` returned 403.
 * The nav editor the resource exists to serve was unusable by anyone.
 *
 * ⚠️ **The gate is CLOSED here.** Nothing in this file opens it, and the member denials are what
 * prove it ran — an authorization test taken with an open gate reports success by not asking.
 *
 * The round-trip assertions are not decoration. The very first write this host ever served exposed a
 * second, independent defect the closed gate had been hiding: `SitemapData` had no `prepare()`/
 * `project()` pair, so a create answered 200 while persisting `payload = null`, then 500'd on the
 * read back. A test that only asserted the status code would have called that a pass.
