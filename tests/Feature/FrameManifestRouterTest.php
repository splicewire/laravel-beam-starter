/**
 * This host emits a manifest-generated router table and writes NO controller to do it.
 *
 * Until OTB M2, `/frame/manifest` here carried `resources` and `contexts` and nothing else — `nav`
 * and `routeContext` existed at exactly ONE host in the estate, which had hand-written its own copy
 * of frame's manifest controller. The projection now ships in `splicewire/laravel-beam-ux` behind
 * frame's `FrameNavContributor` plug; what this host supplies is `config('frame.realms')`, a list it
 * spells out (`api-surface-coherence` 141/142).
 *
 * ⚠️ **Every assertion below is made on BOTH realms, and the two lists are genuinely disjoint.** A
 * test that only ever asked for `tenant` would pass against a projector that ignored the realm and
 * returned every resource to everyone — which is precisely the defect these assertions exist to
 * catch, and it is invisible to a single-realm fixture.

     * `config('frame.middleware')` entirely; a suite built only that way would stay green if the
     * route were deleted (AGENTS.md §*The estate's signature defect*, the 404-body row: *"read the

     * including that the route this host serves is frame's OWN controller and not a host copy.
     *
     * The per-realm tests below cannot use HTTP: this host mounts the manifest once, unscoped, so
     * the `operator` realm is unreachable over the wire and only a direct call can ask for it.
