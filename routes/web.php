    // (absent) props so the client reads one realm context and one manifest cache entry for the whole
    // realm; the console's client router matches `dashboard` and mounts the list shell, whose rows are
    // the realm's summary cards and jump-to tiles (`GET /frame/resources/tenant-dashboard`). Declared
    // here rather than left to the catch-all so the route keeps its name: Fortify, the tests and the
    // seeded account rail all address it as `dashboard`.

    //
    // Two more `account/*` pages, so app.tsx's layout resolution frames them in <AccountShell>, and
    // their nav seats come from `resources/beam-ux/nav.yml`'s `account` realm, seeded into the account
    // sitemap. (`/dashboard` no longer shares that shell: since de4f17b it renders `frame/console`
    // under AppLayout, whose sidebar lists the same account seats.) That is the
    // whole reason these are account-realm pages rather than `settings/*` ones: the packaged
    // SettingsLayout's sub-nav (Profile / Security / Appearance) is a hardcoded list inside
    // `@splicewire/beam-inertia`, so a `settings/tokens` page would have been reachable only by URL,
    // which is the defect this change exists to fix.

    // that file's realm comment for why one capability may not have two surfaces here.

    // ── The THEME entry's editor seat (G2-BEAM-THEME-NAV) ────────────────────────────────────────
    //
    // A third account-realm page, for the same reason the two above are account-realm pages: its nav
    // seat comes from `resources/beam-ux/nav.yml`'s `account` realm and `<AccountShell>` renders that
    // rail. Before this row, changing a theme token meant hand-editing `ThemeSeeder` and reseeding —
    // the theme entry is `type = theme`, and `UxType`'s own doctrine keeps a theme body out of the
    // visual canvas (its body is TOKENS, not a composable tree), so the editor dock had no page to
    // attach to and no surface anywhere mounted the row.
    //
    // ⚠️ **Not a bespoke theme UI, deliberately.** `theme-entries-and-authoring`'s PRD closed Part A §5
    // with the ruling that the theme editor is Frame's form on the `ParticleResource` — so the page
    // body is `@splicewire/beam-ux`'s own `<ThemeEditor>`, which is `useEntryBody` →
    // `RegionInspector`'s `form` body (the REAL `@schemastud/seam` SchemaForm) → Save draft and
    // explicit Publish through the SAME entry operations and fixed-version Release service mounted above. The fields are generated from the
    // server's schema (`EntryBodyEnvelope::schemaFor()` answers a theme entry with `ThemeSchemas`'
    // `{canvas, site}`), so adding a token in PHP adds a field here with no frontend change.
    //
    // It shares `entry` for the same reason `/` and `/dashboard` do, and it is the ONLY way this page
    // can work: the theme row's id is a per-database uuid, so only the server can say which row the
    // page means (`PageEntryRef::theme()`).
    //
    // **Gated on `can:ux.author`.** The `body`/`save-body` operations declare `ability: 'ux.author'`
    // and refuse a guest or a member on their own — that is the lock. This is the door: a screen whose
    // every read and write a principal would be refused should not be offered to them as a page.

    // credentials and change who can reach a team. It is also what keeps the package from deciding,
    // by provider order, which `beam.accounts.tokens.index` a host that already mounts its own
    // (`~/Herd/splicewire-app`) actually serves.

// ── Getting onto a team: `teams.create` and the emailed `invitations.accept` link ───────────────────

// `CreateTeam` op at `teams.store`) and invitation acceptance (the signed `invitations.accept` page every

// here provisions NO team, so these are how a new user gets onto one; `DashboardWelcome` offers
// "Create a team" and mentions invitation links only because these two names exist.
//
// OUTSIDE the `auth` group above on purpose: the accept page must open for a guest, who registers or
// logs in from it and is returned to the link (it is stored as the intended URL). The three signed-in
// routes carry the same `auth` + `verified` as the group; the guest page adds nothing to `web`.

// ── The OPERATOR FRAME CONSOLE mount ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `splicewire/laravel-beam-ux`'s realm-console macro: the operator realm's front door (`operator.home`, a redirect
// to its dashboard leaf), its manifest (`operator.frame.manifest`, frame's own controller with `defaults('realm')`)
// and its console (`operator.frame.console`, constrained to the realm's projected leaves and declared seats, with
// `RealmConsolePageData`'s three props). The door is the realm's own gate (`can:entitlement:os.operate`), so the
// console cannot be a softer door than the dashboard behind it. Registered BEFORE `Route::beamUxSite()`, whose
// `{path}` catch-all would otherwise take the realm's URLs.
//

// The PUBLIC ENTRY RENDERER (ADR-0209 §2) — resolves any unclaimed URL against the `site` realm's
// containment tree and renders the entry through `resources/js/pages/site/entry.tsx`. This is what
// makes the seeded `/docs`, `/docs/api` and `/docs/mcp` live on a fresh install, and what serves every
// page authored after it.
//
// **LAST, and that is load-bearing.** It registers a `{path}` catch-all, so every named route above
// must already be declared or it gets swallowed. `claimRoot: false` (the default) leaves `/` to the
// `site/home` route above; a site served WHOLLY from entries passes `claimRoot: true` instead.
//
// It also mounts the compiled-artifact route the page shell imports, above its own catch-all. The
// renderer 404s uniformly on anything it cannot resolve, gate, and read — so an incumbent catch-all
// of your own must be registered BELOW this line, or `/{any}` never sees a request again.
