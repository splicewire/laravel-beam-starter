    // under AppLayout, whose sidebar lists the same account seats.) That is the

    // ── The THEME entry's editor seat (G2-BEAM-THEME-NAV) ────────────────────────────────────────
    //
    // A third account-realm page, for the same reason the two above are account-realm pages: its nav
    // seat comes from `resources/beam-ux/nav.yml`'s `account` realm and `<AccountShell>` renders that
    // rail. Before this row, changing a theme token meant hand-editing `ThemeSeeder` and reseeding —
    // the theme entry is `type = theme`, and `UxType`'s own doctrine keeps a theme body out of the
    // visual canvas (its body is TOKENS, not a composable tree), so the editor dock had no page to
    // attach to and no surface anywhere mounted the row.
    //
    // ⚠️ **Not a bespoke theme UI, deliberately.** `theme-entries-and-authoring`'s PRD closed Part A §5
    // with the ruling that the theme editor is Frame's form on the `ParticleResource` — so the page
    // body is `@splicewire/beam-ux`'s own `<ThemeEditor>`, which is `useEntryBody` →
    // `RegionInspector`'s `form` body (the REAL `@schemastud/seam` SchemaForm) → Save draft and
    // explicit Publish through the SAME entry operations and fixed-version Release service mounted above. The fields are generated from the
    // server's schema (`EntryBodyEnvelope::schemaFor()` answers a theme entry with `ThemeSchemas`'
    // `{canvas, site}`), so adding a token in PHP adds a field here with no frontend change.
    //
    // It shares `entry` for the same reason `/` and `/dashboard` do, and it is the ONLY way this page
    // can work: the theme row's id is a per-database uuid, so only the server can say which row the
    // page means (`PageEntryRef::theme()`).
    //
    // **Gated on `can:ux.author`.** The `body`/`save-body` operations declare `ability: 'ux.author'`

    // every read and write a principal would be refused should not be offered to them as a page.

// **LAST, and that is load-bearing.** It registers a `{path}` catch-all, so every named route above
// must already be declared or it gets swallowed. `claimRoot: false` (the default) leaves `/` to the

// It also mounts the compiled-artifact route the page shell imports, above its own catch-all. The
