    // addressed by the entry's **id**.
    //
    // This replaces `Route::beamUxEntries()` (beam-docs-satellite ticket 40). That macro mounted a
    // bespoke `GET|PUT beam/ux/entries/{slug}/body` controller, and it was bespoke for exactly one
    // reason: it addressed by SLUG where the particle pipeline addresses by id — which is what let a
    // namespaced and a null-namespace entry sharing one slug serve the WRONG row with no error. The
    // three starters were the LAST holders of that mount.
    //
    // Both ops declare their own `ability: 'ux.author'` with `abilityModel: false` (§3) — that

    //
    //   save-draft  record an edited body as a version WITHOUT publishing it — a guest keeps reading
    //               the published body, because the artifact they are served is addressed by the

    // rail. Before this row, changing a theme token meant hand-editing `ThemeSeeder` and reseeding —
    // the theme entry is `type = theme`, and `UxType`'s own doctrine keeps a theme body out of the
    // visual canvas (its body is TOKENS, not a composable tree), so the editor dock had no page to
    // attach to and no surface anywhere mounted the row.
    //
    // ⚠️ **Not a bespoke theme UI, deliberately.** `theme-entries-and-authoring`'s PRD closed Part A §5
    // with the ruling that the theme editor is Frame's form on the `ParticleResource` — so the page
    // body is `@splicewire/beam-ux`'s own `<ThemeEditor>`, which is `useEntryBody` →
    // `RegionInspector`'s `form` body (the REAL `@schemastud/seam` SchemaForm) → `useSaveEntryBody`

    // server's schema (`EntryBodyEnvelope::schemaFor()` answers a theme entry with `ThemeSchemas`'
    // `{canvas, site}`), so adding a token in PHP adds a field here with no frontend change.
    //
    // It shares `entry` for the same reason `/` and `/dashboard` do, and it is the ONLY way this page

// here", because `@splicewire/beam-inertia`'s `pages/frame/console.tsx` fetched a hardcoded
// `/frame/manifest` and mounted `<BrowserRouter>` with no basename, while this realm's `routeContext`
// paths are realm-RELATIVE (`users`) and its nav hrefs realm-PREFIXED (`/operator/users`). One packaged

//   · `basename`    — `<BrowserRouter basename>`, so realm-relative leaves match under `/operator`.
//   · `manifestUrl` — this realm's own manifest mount, below.
//
// Gated on the SAME entitlement as `/operator` itself, so the console cannot be a softer door than the
