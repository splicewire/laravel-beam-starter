/**
 * The invitations table. Formerly `invitations`, renamed `invitations` → `beam_invitations`
 * (beam-particle-rename ticket 04), routed through the single table-prefix seam {@see Beam::table()}.
 *
 * Data-preserving rename (NOT drop+create): where the pre-rename `invitations` already exists in THIS
 * schema, it is renamed in place, preserving every row and its FK to `beam_teams` (Postgres keeps the
 * reference valid across a parent rename). A fresh install (neither table present) creates the target
 * directly with the FK pointed at the PREFIXED parent (`beam_teams`) — the create-branch footgun this
 * slice fixes. Guarded on the CURRENT schema explicitly (the CLAUDE.md footgun) so the logic is
 * order-independent and idempotent.
 *
 * NOT squashed with `add_lifecycle_to_invitations_table` — this whole `teams/` directory converts 1:1
 * (extension/location/registration only, logic untouched): the data-preserving rename above already
 * ran against real deployed data, so folding the later lifecycle-columns ALTER into a "clean create"
 * would silently skip landing those columns on a host that already ran the original migrations.
