/**
 * The teams table. Formerly `teams`, renamed `teams` → `beam_teams` (beam-particle-rename ticket 04),
 * routed through the single table-prefix seam {@see Beam::table()}.
 *
 * Data-preserving rename (NOT drop+create): where the pre-rename `teams` already exists in THIS
 * schema, it is renamed in place, preserving every row (Postgres re-points child FKs to the renamed
 * table automatically, so `beam_memberships`/`beam_invitations` stay valid). A fresh install (neither
 * table present) creates the target directly. Guarded on the CURRENT schema explicitly (not
 * Schema::hasTable, which follows the tenant search_path — the CLAUDE.md footgun) so the guarded logic
 * is order-independent and idempotent across re-runs.
 *
 * NOT squashed with `add_current_team_id_to_users_table` or `add_lifecycle_to_invitations_table` —
 * this whole `teams/` directory converts 1:1 (extension/location/registration only, logic untouched):
 * the data-preserving rename above already ran against real deployed data, so folding a later ALTER
 * into a "clean create" would silently skip landing that column on a host that already ran the
 * original migrations.
