/**
 * `beam_teams.slug` — the stable, globally-unique public name a `to_teams:` recipient selector in an
 * `x-beam-notify` keyword addresses (beam-facade 100 D5, built by 159). A selector authored into a
 * JSON Schema that travels between hosts cannot name an auto-increment key.
 *
 * ## Why the column is declared in TWO files
 *
 * `create_teams_table` declares it NULLABLE and this migration constrains it, because a NOT NULL
 * column with no default cannot be added to a POPULATED table and that create guard is CONVERGENT: on
 * a host whose `beam_teams` already holds rows, a NOT NULL declaration there raises
 * `SchemaConflict::REQUIRED_ADDITION` and the host simply stops migrating. Nullable converges
 * everywhere, so greenfield and populated hosts walk the same two files and differ only in how much
 * the backfill has to do.
 *
 * The three steps are the estate's standing repair for this hazard (beam-facade 27): **add nullable,
 * backfill, constrain.** Each is individually guarded, so a host that has already taken part of it
 * (its create ran with the column, or a previous run of this migration got partway) skips what it has.
 *
 * ## The backfill mirrors the model, and cannot call it
 *
 * {@see \Splicewire\Beam\Accounts\Models\Team::slugSource()} derives a personal team's slug from the
 * OWNER's handle and everything else from the team name. This restates that in SQL-safe terms rather
 * than booting the model, because a migration runs against whatever schema exists at that moment and a
 * model carrying a global scope, a cast or an accessor from a later state of the package would read a
 * table that does not exist yet. The duplication is deliberate and bounded: it runs once per host and
 * the model owns every slug written after it.
